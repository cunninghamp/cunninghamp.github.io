Many of the customer projects I work on involve collecting an inventory of basic information about the Windows Servers in the environment, such as CPU/memory specs, OS versions, volume sizes, and so on.

To make this inventory process less time consuming I began using PowerShell scripts to collect the information I was interested. Over time these scripts got less messy and more useful, so now I want to share my current script.

This PowerShell script, **Collect-ServerInfo.ps1**, will collect information from Windows Servers that includes:

- Computer system information (name, make, model, processor, memory, domain)
- Operating system information (OS name, version, install date)
- Memory information (capacity, modules, speed)
- Pagefile information (size, location)
- BIOS information (manufacturer, version, release date)
- Logical disk information
- Volume information
- Network interface information
- Software information

The information is output to a HTML file per server.

```

Collects information about all servers in Active Directory.
